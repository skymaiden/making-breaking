For our fitting bra we need to use real bra materials and proper techniques. This will be a plain unlined bra, without foam, because the purpose of this bra is to evaluate fit precisely and make adjustments to the pattern.

## Step 1: Prepare the pieces

Because this tester bra isn't lined or use foam, we'll do a [no-finish neckline edge](https://www.braandcorsetsupplies.com/2019/11/10/the-no-finish-neckline-edge/), so that we won't need to finish the upper cup with elastic: trim off the seam allowance from the upper cup pattern piece.

Decide which side of the main fabric you want on the outside (Duoplex can be sewn with shiny side on the inside or the outside). Fold the fabric, line up the DOGS correctly, and cut out the pattern pieces (both layers at the same time). We need to cut mirrored to get pieces for the left and right sides.<br>

Main fabric:

- 2 x upper cup pieces (mirrored, with top edge along the fold)
- 2 x lower side cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower front cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x cradle pieces (with bridge edge along the fold)

Band fabric:

- 2 x back band pieces (mirrored)

Transfer notches with a washable marker, and lay out the pieces so it's easier to see what's what.

## Step 2: Sew the cups

1. Pin the lower front cup on top of the lower side cup, right sides together. Make sure the notches match.
2. With a straight stitch: sew the lower cup pieces together, easing curves where necessary.
3. Press the seams open, top stitch, and trim seam allowances carefully.
4. Pin the folded upper cup piece on top of the lower cup, right sides together. Make sure to match the notch to the seam line, with the lower cup triangles pointing towards the upper cup. The shorter end of the upper cup aligns with the lower side piece, and the longer end goes over the lower front piece.
5. Sew the cup pieces together, easing curves where necessary.
6. Press seams open, top stitch, and trim seam allowances carefully.
7. Repeat for the other cup.

## Step 3: Sew the band

1. Pin the cradle pieces together at the bridge, right sides together.
   With a straight stitch: sew the cradle pieces together at the bridge. Press the seam allowance to the inside and under stitch it.
2. Baste the other sides about 4mm from the fabric edges, to keep the two layers together.
3. With a straight stitch: sew the band pieces to the cradle. Press seams towards the cradle, top stitch, and trim seam allowances carefully.

## Step 4: Attach the cups to the band

1. Match the cradle notches to the cup seam lines, easing in the curves where necessary.
2. With a straight stitch: sew the cups to the cradle, with band on top and cup underneath.

## Step 5: Apply elastics and hardware

### Attach the channeling

1. Align the channeling to the stitch line on the inside of the cup seam allowance, with the plushy side facing towards the inside of the cup.<br>
   With a straight stitch, sew close to the inner edge of the channeling, leaving 1” unsewn on underarm ends. On the bridge ends, trim and bar tack to close.

### Apply lower band elastic

1. First pass: right side of bra facing up
   - With the plushy side of elastic facing up, line up the straight edge of the elastic to the edge of band fabric.
   - Zig-zag as close as possible to the picots, stretching ½” under cup curves.
   - When you get to the bridge curve, clip the fabric along the curve to sew the elastic straight.
2. Second pass: wrong side of bra facing up
   - Fold the elastic towards the inside of the bra.
   - 3-step zig-zag on the straight edge of the elastic. This will show on the outside.
3. Check that the hook & eye closure will fit
   - Place the underarm elastic on the top edge of the band
   - Trim the top band edge if the band is taller than the closure.

### Apply upper band / underarm elastic

1. Allow 1" excess at the top to hold strap rings.
2. Sew the elastic as the steps above, stretching only a tiny bit along the upper cup.

### Finish the channeling

1. With the channeling facing away from the cups (towards the cradle), top stitch from the outside, stretching the cradle and cups apart to get close to the seam line. Make sure to align the loose underarm ends to the seam line!<br>
2. Do a second line of stitching from the inside of the bra, close to the edge of the channeling.
3. Trim the channeling on the underarm side so it's completely concealed.
4. Insert the underwires inside the channeling – make sure they go into the tube, not between the channeling and the fabric.

### Prepare the straps

1. Cut a length of strap elastic, loop it through a slider, sew it closed.
2. Loop the other end through a ring, then back through the slider.
3. Sew free end at back band.
4. Loop the excess underarm elastic through the ring and sew it down to secure.

### Attach the hook & eye closure

1. Sew the closures. With the bra face down, positioned as if you were going to wear it:
   - Sew the eyes facing out, on the left band.
   - Sew the hooks facing in, on the right band.
   - Make sure to sew with hooks/eyes facing up, so they don’t get stuck in feed dogs!
