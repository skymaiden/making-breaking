Now you can finally try on the bra and evaluate the fit like you did with your toile:

- Are the straps the right length and adjusted properly? Are they falling too far out, or sitting too far in?
- Is the band sitting straight all the way around? Is it too tight or too loose in some places?
- Is the bridge (and wires) cutting into the breast tissue, or not filling the space?
- Are the cups too tight or too loose in some places?

You can make adjustments in the same way you did for your toile, transfering the changes over to the paper pattern pieces.

Once you’ve made your pattern adjustments, you’ll need to make another bra to check the fit again.
It’s worth persevering to get a good fit, because once you have achieved that then you can make as many as you like – making stylistic changes and combining different fabrics, elastics, necklines, seam lines, straps, details, etc. for a collection of well-fitting bras that all look different! You can try sewing with lace, sheer lining, foam, tulle, or whatever other combinations inspire you.

Below are the bras I made using this pattern.

If you like learning by watching, Beverly Johnson’s online bra making classes are amazing: [Construction and fit](https://www.craftsy.com/class/sewing-bras-construction-fit/), [Designer techniques](https://www.craftsy.com/class/sewing-bras-designer-techniques/), and [Foam, lace and beyond](https://www.craftsy.com/class/sewing-bras-foam-lace-beyond/). These are basically where I learned how to actually sew a bra.

I also bought the very affordable [Bare Essentials: Bras](https://porcelynne.com/books-classes/bare-essentials-bras-third-edition) ebook by Jennifer Lynne Matthews-Fairbanks, which contains a wealth of information on bra construction – but also a section dedicated to drafting bra patterns! <br>

I've heard great things about the [Orange Lingerie](https://orange-lingerie.com/) book for fitting issues. The [Liz sews](https://www.youtube.com/c/LizSews/) Youtube channel also has some nice sew-along videos for various bra patterns (including a foam version of the Maya bra).
