For our fitting bra we need to use real bra materials and proper techniques. This will be a plain unlined bra, without foam, because the purpose of this bra is to evaluate fit precisely and make adjustments to the pattern.

## Step 1: Prepare the pieces

Because this tester bra isn't lined or use foam, we'll do a [no-finish neckline edge](https://www.braandcorsetsupplies.com/2019/11/10/the-no-finish-neckline-edge/), so that we won't need to finish the upper cup with elastic: trim off the seam allowance from the upper cup pattern piece.

Decide which side of the main fabric you want on the outside (Duoplex can be sewn with shiny side on the inside or the outside). Fold the fabric, line up the DOGS correctly, and cut out the pattern pieces (both layers at the same time). We need to cut mirrored to get pieces for the left and right sides.<br>

Main fabric:

- 2 x upper cup pieces (mirrored, with top edge along the fold)
- 2 x lower side cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower front cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x cradle pieces (with bridge edge along the fold)

Band fabric:

- 2 x back band pieces (mirrored)

## Step 2: Sew the cups

1. With a straight stitch: sew the lower cup pieces together, matching notches and easing curves where necessary. Press seams open, top stitch, and trim seam allowances carefully.
2. With a straight stitch: sew the folded upper cup piece to lower cup, matching notch to seam line, and easing curves where necessary. Press seams open, top stitch, and trim seam allowances carefully.

## Step 3: Sew the band

1. With a straight stitch: sew the cradle pieces together at the bridge. Press the seam allowance to the inside and under stitch it.
2. With a straight stitch: sew the band pieces to the cradle. Press seams towards the cradle, top stitch, and trim seam allowances carefully.

## Step 4: Attach the cups to the band

1. Match notches to seam lines, ease in the curves
2. Sew with band on top, cup underneath

<em>It's starting to look like a bra!</em>

## Step 5: Apply elastics and hardware

### Attach the channeling

1. Sew the channeling to the inside of the cup seam allowance, with the plushy side facing towards the inside of the cup.<br>
   Leave 1” unsewn on underarm ends. On the bridge ends, trim and bar tack to close.

### Apply lower band elastic

1. First pass: right side of bra facing up
   - plushy side of elastic facing up, line up straight edge of elastic to edge of band
   - zig-zag close to picots, stretching ½” under cup curve
   - clip curve under bridge to sew elastic straight under there
2. Second pass: wrong side of bra facing up
   - Fold elastic towards inside
   - 3-step zig-zag on straight edge side of elastic
3. Check that hook and eye will fit
   - Align top elastic to top of band
   - Cut band top if necessary

### Apply upper band elastic

1. Allow excess at top to hold strap rings.
2. Sew in the same way as band elastic, stretching slightly along upper cup only

### Finish the channeling

1. Top stitch from the outside, stretching the cradle and cups apart to get close to the seam line.<br>
   Under stitch from the inside, close to the edge of the channeling – make sure to align the underarm ends properly!

### Prepare the straps

1. Cut a length of strap elastic, loop it through a slider, sew it closed
2. Loop the other end through a ring, then back through the slider
3. Sew end at back band
4. Loop the excess top elastic through the ring and sew it down

### Attach the hook & eye closure

1. Sew closures, with bra positioned to be worn
   - Sew eyes on bra left (facing out), hooks on bra right (facing in)
   - Make sure to sew with hooks/eyes facing up, so they don’t get stuck in feed dogs
