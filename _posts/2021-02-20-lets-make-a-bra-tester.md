<em><strong>Note:</strong> ignore the choppy fabric edges in the photos below, my fabric shears got jammed so I cut everything out with my paper scissors...</em> üòÜ

<br>

## Step 1: Prepare the pattern

### Closure

Check that the hook & eye closure fits between the sewing lines. If it doesn't, draw a new line from the narrow band edge to the wider edge to make it fit.

### Elastic

We need to make sure our elastic fits along the top and bottom edges (otherwise we'll be making the bra shorter in height and our wires won't fit). The pattern includes 8mm seam allowances all around, so:

- For 10mm top elastic, extend the seam allowance by 2mm along the top of the back band, cradle, and the angled edge of the upper cup piece.
- For 12mm bottom elastic, extend the seam allowance by 4mm along the bottom of the back band and cradle.

<small><em>Closure laid on pattern to verify it fits. Seam allowances increased to match elastic sizes on back band, cradle, and upper cup angled edge.</em></small>

## Step 2: Cut the fabric

Fold the fabric, line up the DOGS correctly, and cut out the pattern pieces (both layers at the same time). We cut mirrored to get pieces for the left and right sides.<br>

<small><em>We really don't need that much fabric, and playing tetris with pattern pieces means less waste! Just keep the DOGS correct.</em></small>

### Main fabric

- 2 x upper cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower side cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower front cup pieces (mirrored)
- 1 x cradle pieces (with bridge edge along the fold)

### Lining fabric

- 2 x upper cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower side cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower front cup pieces (mirrored)
- 1 x cradle piece (with bridge edge along the fold)

### Band fabric

- 2 x back band pieces (mirrored)

<br>
<em>Note: If your fabric isn't wide enough to place the cradle on the fold with the DOGS going the right way, you can chop it in two and add a seam allowance:</em>

<small><em>These pieces are arranged like this just for illustration ‚Äì before cutting them, I turned the cradle piece upside down and moved it up into that empty space, to make better use of fabric.</em></small>

Transfer notches with a washable marker, and lay out the pieces so it's easier to see what's what.

<small><em>Main and lining fabric pieces laid out together. I have a separate bridge piece here, to make use of some leftover fabric.</em></small>

## Step 3: Sew the cups

We'll enclose all the seams to make everything as pretty on the inside as it is on the outside.

### Prepare the lower cup

1. Lay all the cup pieces for one side together in this order: main lower side cup (facing up), main lower front cup (facing down), lining lower front cup, lining lower side cup. You should have a sandwich of main/main/lining/lining. Pin at the apex notch.
2. With a straight stitch, sew the pieces together carefully, easing curves where necessary.
3. Open the cup so that the main fabric is on the outside, and the lining on the inside. The seams should all be cleanly tucked away underneath.
4. Press on very low heat, and top stitch. Repeat for the other cup.

<small><em>The sandwich order might seem pedantic, but it means no exposed seams on the inside or outside!</em></small>

### Attach the upper cup to the lower cup

1. Right sides together, pin the main upper cup piece to the top of the lower cup. Align the notch to the lower cup seam line.
2. Turn the pieces over, and pin the lining upper cup piece to the top of the other side of the lower cup. You should have a sandwich of main/main/lining/lining.
3. With a straight stitch, sew the pieces together carefully, easing curves where necessary.
   <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/duckgoesoink/image/upload/v1614013664/ABA3A1D7-0ACD-4D8B-96C6-BF3F0D931A25_c1accp.jpg" alt="" width="500" />
4. Burrito time! This is where it gets weird:<br>
   - Roll the lower cup to get it out of the way, and open up the upper cup pieces (see fig. 1 below).<br>
   - Pin the upper cup main and lining edges together, _over the rolled-up lower cup_ (see fig. 2).
   - _Stitch the long straight edge_ of the two upper cup pieces, right sides together. You should end up with a strange sausage kind of thing (see fig. 3).<br>
     <em><strong>Note:</strong> don't stitch along the short angled edge like I did, or you'll need to unpick that to apply the underarm elastic later!</em><br>
5. Pull the cup out through the open end, so all the right sides are facing out and the seams are tucked away inside.
6. Press and top stitch. Repeat for the other cup.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/duckgoesoink/image/upload/v1613996131/maya-bra-cup-enclosed-seams_xjtjh1.jpg" alt="" />
<small><em>This is unintuitive, but when you turn the cup out, all the seams are magically enclosed on both sides!</em>‚ú®</small>

## Step 4: Sew the band

We‚Äôll sew the band with enclosed seams too. A tiny bit of trickery is involved, but much less than the upper cup burrito weirdness above.

### Attach the back band to the cradle

1. Lay the cradle and band pieces for one side together in this order: main cradle (facing up), band (facing down and towards the center), lining (facing up). You should have a sandwich of main/band/lining.<br>
   <em>Note: The little pointy end at the top is normal, it will line up with the cradle when opened up.</em>
2. With a straight stitch, sew the pieces together carefully.
3. Open the band so that the main fabric is on the outside, and the lining on the inside. The seams should all be cleanly tucked away inside.
4. Press and top stitch. Repeat for the other side.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/duckgoesoink/image/upload/v1613991183/maya-bra-band-cradle_lc691v.jpg" alt="" width="500" />
<small><em>The band is attached to the cradle with completely enclosed seams.</em></small>

### Finish the bridge

1. Pin the cradle pieces together at the bridge, right sides together.
2. With a straight stitch: sew the bridge along the top.
3. Open the cradle so that the main fabric is on the outside, and the lining on the inside. Press the bridge seam allowance towards the lining and under stitch it.
4. Press the bridge seam flat (the under stitching shouldn't be visible from the outside). Baste the other open edges about 4mm from the fabric edges, to keep the two layers together.

<small><em>Basting the open edges is optional, but makes it easier to attach cups and elastics later.</em></small>

## Step 5: Attach the cups to the band

1. Match the cradle notches to the cup seam lines, easing in the curves where necessary.
   <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/duckgoesoink/image/upload/v1614019390/6636F593-3F07-4B56-8237-8C6FEC2BD7AF_anenl6.jpg" alt="" width="500" />
2. With a straight stitch: sew the cups to the cradle, with band on top and cup underneath.

<em>It's starting to look like a bra!</em>

## Step 6: Apply elastics and hardware

### Attach the channeling

1. Align the channeling to the stitch line on the _inside of the cup seam allowance_, with the plushy side facing towards the inside of the cup.
2. With a straight stitch, sew the inner edge of the channeling _to the seam allowance_ ‚Äì stopping at the lower/upper cup seam line at the underarm ends. The stitching is only on the seam allowance and shouldn't show from the outside.
3. Trim the channeling, and bar tack it at the bridge end to close.

### Prepare the straps

1. Cut a length of strap elastic, loop it through a slider, sew it closed.
2. Loop the other end through a ring, then back through the slider.

### Apply lower band elastic

1. First pass: right side of bra facing up
   - With the plushy side of elastic facing up, line up the straight edge of the elastic to the edge of band fabric.
   - Zig-zag as close as possible to the picots, stretching ¬Ω‚Äù under cup curves.
   - When you get to the bridge curve, clip the fabric along the curve to sew the elastic straight.
2. Second pass: wrong side of bra facing up
   - Fold the elastic towards the inside of the bra.
   - Place a strap end on each back band, inside the folded elastic, shiny side down/plushy side up.
   - 3-step zig-zag on the straight edge of the elastic. This will show on the outside.
3. Check that the hook & eye closure will fit
   - Place the underarm elastic on the top edge of the band
   - Trim the top band edge if the band is taller than the closure.

### Apply upper band / underarm elastic

1. Allow 1" excess at the top to hold strap rings.
2. Sew the elastic as the steps above, stretching only a tiny bit along the upper cup.

### Finish the channeling

1. With the channeling facing away from the cups (towards the cradle), top stitch from the outside, stretching the cradle and cups apart to get close to the seam line. Make sure to align the loose underarm ends to the seam line!<br>
2. Do a second line of stitching from the inside of the bra, close to the edge of the channeling.
3. Trim the channeling on the underarm side so it's completely concealed.
4. Insert the underwires inside the channeling ‚Äì make sure they go into the tube, not between the channeling and the fabric.

### Finish the straps, attach the hook & eye closure

1. Loop the excess underarm elastic through the strap ring, stitch to secure the strap.
2. Sew the closures. With the bra face down, positioned as if you were going to wear it:
   - Sew the eyes facing out, on the left band.
   - Sew the hooks facing in, on the right band.
   - Make sure to sew with hooks/eyes facing up, so they don‚Äôt get stuck in feed dogs!
