Before using proper fabric, it can be helpful to sew a toile to get familiar with the pattern and do a first round of adjustments. You might want to make a [toile with cups and band](https://orange-lingerie.com/blogs/news/how-to-test-a-bra-sewing-pattern/), or you might prefer to start with a [fitting band](https://merckwaerdigh.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/step-7-sewing-the-fitting-band/) and then work on cups separately. For a [basic toile](https://clothhabit.com/bra-making-sew-along-a-trial-run/) without elastics:

1. Cut out pattern pieces from scrap fabric (stable for the cups and cradle, stretchy for the back band) – leaving a bigger seam allowance for adjustments.
2. Baste the cup pieces together
   - Lower pieces, matching notches
   - Upper to lower pieces, matching notch to seam line
3. Baste the band and cradle together.
4. Baste the cups to the band, matching notches to seam lines.
5. Baste straps and a hook and eye closure (you can reuse these later).

Try on the bra in front of a mirror and [evaluate the fit](https://merckwaerdigh.wordpress.com/2017/03/03/free-printable-the-bra-fitting-checklist) of the band, the cradle, the cups…

Examples of major adjustments:

- If the band is way too big or small: go down or up a band size and try again.
- If the cups are way too big or small: go up a cup size and try again.
- If the cup shape doesn't match your natural shape: you might need to grade between two sizes.

Examples of minor adjustments:

- If some areas are too big or loose: pinch out the excess and adjust the pattern to match.
- If some areas are too small or tight: let out some of the seam allowance and re-baste to check again, then adjust the pattern to match.

I found these Cloth Habit articles about [band adjustments](https://clothhabit.com/bra-making-band-adjustment/) and [cup adjustments](https://clothhabit.com/bra-making-sew-along-cup-adjustments/) very helpful. This Liz Sews video about [how she fit a pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdv_sdo1h1o) to herself is where I realised that bra patterns can be graded just like any other sewing pattern!
