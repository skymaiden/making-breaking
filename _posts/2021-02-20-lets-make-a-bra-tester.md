For our tester/fitting bra we need to use real bra materials and proper techniques. This will be a lined bra without foam, for precise fit evaulation and pattern adjustments.

Let's get into the nitty gritty!

1. [Prepare the pattern](#step-1-prepare-the-pattern)
2. [Cut the fabric](#step-2-cut-the-fabric)
3. [Sew the cups](#step-3-sew-the-cups)
4. [Sew the band](#step-4-sew-the-band)
5. [Attach the cups to the band](#step-5-attach-the-cups-to-the-band)
6. [Apply elastics and hardware](#step-6-apply-elastics-and-hardware)

## Step 1: Prepare the pattern

### Closure

Check that the hook & eye closure fits between the sewing lines. If it doesn't, draw a new line from the narrow band edge to the wider edge so that it does fit.

### Elastic

We need to make sure our elastic fits along the top and bottom edges (otherwise we'll be making the bra shorter in height and our wires won't fit). The pattern includes 8mm seam allowances all around, so:

- For 10mm top elastic, extend the seam allowance by 2mm along the top of the back band, cradle, and the angled edge of the upper cup piece.
- For 12mm bottom elastic, extend the seam allowance by 4mm along the bottom of the back band and cradle.

## Step 2: Cut the fabric

Fold the fabric, line up the DOGS correctly, and cut out the pattern pieces (both layers at the same time). We need to cut mirrored to get pieces for the left and right sides.<br>

### Main fabric

- 2 x upper cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower side cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower front cup pieces (mirrored)
- 1 x cradle pieces (with bridge edge along the fold)

### Lining

- 2 x upper cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower side cup pieces (mirrored)
- 2 x lower front cup pieces (mirrored)
- 1 x cradle piece (with bridge edge along the fold)

### Band fabric

- 2 x back band pieces (mirrored)

<br>
<em>Note: If your fabric isn't wide enough to place the cradle on the fold with the DOGS going the right way, you can chop it in two and add a seam allowance:</em>

Transfer notches with a washable marker, and lay out the pieces so it's easier to see what's what.

## Step 3: Sew the cups

We'll enclose all the seams to make everything as pretty on the inside as it is on the outside.

### Prepare the lower cup

1. Lay all the cup pieces for one side together in this order: main lower side cup (facing up), main lower front cup (facing down), lining lower front cup, lining lower side cup. You should have a sandwich of main/main/lining/lining. Pin at the apex notch.
2. With a straight stitch, sew the pieces together carefully, easing curves where necessary.
3. Open the cup so that the main fabric is on the outside, and the lining on the inside. The seams should all be cleanly tucked away underneath.
4. Press and top stitch. Repeat for the other cup.

### Attach the upper cup to the lower cup

1. Right sides together, lay the main upper cup piece along the top of the lower cup.
   The lower cup triangles should be pointing upwards, the angled edge of the upper cup on the lower side piece, and the longer edge on the lower front piece.
   Pin with the upper cup notch aligned to the lower cup seam line.
2. Turn the pieces over, and pin the lining upper cup piece to the top of the other side of the lower cup.
3. With a straight stitch, sew all the pieces together carefully, easing curves where necessary.
4. Burrito time! Open the cup with the lining and main upper cup pieces on opposite sides, and the lower cup in the middle. Roll the lower cup to get it out of the way, and stitch the straight edge of the two upper cup pieces, right sides together.
5. Pull the cup out so all the right sides are facing out and the seams are tucked away inside.
6. Press and top stitch. Repeat for the other cup.

## Step 4: Sew the band

1. Pin the cradle pieces together at the bridge, right sides together.
   With a straight stitch: sew the cradle pieces together at the bridge. Press the seam allowance to the inside and under stitch it.
2. Baste the other sides about 4mm from the fabric edges, to keep the two layers together.
3. With a straight stitch: sew the band pieces to the cradle. Press seams towards the cradle, top stitch, and trim seam allowances carefully.

## Step 5: Attach the cups to the band

1. Match the cradle notches to the cup seam lines, easing in the curves where necessary.
2. With a straight stitch: sew the cups to the cradle, with band on top and cup underneath.

<em>It's starting to look like a bra!</em>

## Step 6: Apply elastics and hardware

### Attach the channeling

1. Align the channeling to the stitch line on the inside of the cup seam allowance, with the plushy side facing towards the inside of the cup.<br>
   With a straight stitch, sew close to the inner edge of the channeling, leaving 1‚Äù unsewn on underarm ends. On the bridge ends, trim and bar tack to close.

### Prepare the straps

1. Cut a length of strap elastic, loop it through a slider, sew it closed.
2. Loop the other end through a ring, then back through the slider.

### Apply lower band elastic

1. First pass: right side of bra facing up
   - With the plushy side of elastic facing up, line up the straight edge of the elastic to the edge of band fabric.
   - Zig-zag as close as possible to the picots, stretching ¬Ω‚Äù under cup curves.
   - When you get to the bridge curve, clip the fabric along the curve to sew the elastic straight.
2. Second pass: wrong side of bra facing up
   - Fold the elastic towards the inside of the bra.
   - Place a strap end on each back band, inside the folded elastic, shiny side down/plushy side up.
   - 3-step zig-zag on the straight edge of the elastic. This will show on the outside.
3. Check that the hook & eye closure will fit
   - Place the underarm elastic on the top edge of the band
   - Trim the top band edge if the band is taller than the closure.

### Apply upper band / underarm elastic

1. Allow 1" excess at the top to hold strap rings.
2. Sew the elastic as the steps above, stretching only a tiny bit along the upper cup.

### Finish the channeling

1. With the channeling facing away from the cups (towards the cradle), top stitch from the outside, stretching the cradle and cups apart to get close to the seam line. Make sure to align the loose underarm ends to the seam line!<br>
2. Do a second line of stitching from the inside of the bra, close to the edge of the channeling.
3. Trim the channeling on the underarm side so it's completely concealed.
4. Insert the underwires inside the channeling ‚Äì make sure they go into the tube, not between the channeling and the fabric.

### Finish the straps, attach the hook & eye closure

1. Loop the excess underarm elastic through the strap ring, stitch to secure the strap.
2. Sew the closures. With the bra face down, positioned as if you were going to wear it:
   - Sew the eyes facing out, on the left band.
   - Sew the hooks facing in, on the right band.
   - Make sure to sew with hooks/eyes facing up, so they don‚Äôt get stuck in feed dogs!
