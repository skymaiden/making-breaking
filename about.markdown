Hi there, welcome to my little corner of the internet ðŸ˜Š

I'm Hinerangi, a [kiwi](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_(people)>) living in France, obsessed with learning and making everything I can. Currently learning to mend, sew and knit my wardrobe.

This is some sort of public notebook for documenting stuff I'm learning â€“ because I'll probably forget things if I don't write them down, and maybe someone else might find the information interesting.

If you like looking at photos, I post the things I make on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/duckgoesoink). I also have a [cute dog](https://instagram.com/north_bt) if you like that kind of thing.
